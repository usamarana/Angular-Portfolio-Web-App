# Angular-Web-App
## Developed by Usama Rana
This portfolio webapp is made to demonstrate knowledge of REST API management on the Frontend using Angular V16.

It uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/components/categories) components such as Table, Pagination, Sorting, Dialog to display the API data on the UI.

Routing between the different components is also demonstrated, as well as loading the data gracefully using loader service to manage the loading state.

**GET:** This request is used to display the list of users in People API section (Pagination and sorting is functional on the table)

**POST:** This request is used to create new users in Booking API which can then be shown in the table (Once the user is successfully created you will then be routed to the list table)

**PUT:** This request is used to edit/modify existing user details when clicking on the names in the list table

**DELETE:** This request is used to delete the users when clicking on the delete button in the "Actions" column inside the list table
